# AS51019 Peering Policy

## Scope

This peering policy applies for requests for peering to AS51019.

We will not ask other networks to adhere to this peering policy
if the request for peering is sent from us, and/or if we benefit
more from the intereconnection.

## Filtering

1. We will filter for netmasks:

   - Equal to or larger than /8 on IPv4
   - Equal to or less than /24 on IPv4
   - Equal to or larger than /12 on IPv6
   - Equal to or less than /48 on IPv6

2. We will drop RPKI-invalid prefixes

3. We will apply a maximum route limit based on information from
   PeeringDB. If it is not available a limit with generous head-
   room will be set based on prefix count data after the peering
   is established.

4. We will only accept prefixes that are publicly routable
   unicast space (drop RFC1918 and others).

## Peering preferences

Please peer with us on both IPv6 and IPv4 when available. Even if
you do not send IPv4/IPv6 routes we may, and you may in the
future.

Please establish peering sessions on all mutual IXPs for a given
point of presence, for redundancy.

Only send traffic to us destined to prefixes announced from 51019
or a downstream of 51019 (no default route).

## Recommendations

We apply BGP local preference to routes received over IXPs who
cost less or PNI, we recommend you do this as well.
